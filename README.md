# ✨ FlowHivee 🌐⭐

**FlowHivee** is a complete **offline EdTech software** that runs entirely off-grid on a DIY mini server 💻.  
It’s hosted on a repurposed **Lenovo ThinkCentre** which creates its own **LAN (Local Area Network)** so anyone nearby can connect and learn **without needing the internet** 😭  

FlowHivee is designed for **rural areas** where access to online education is limited. It brings together lessons, quizzes, videos, notes, and progress tracking — all stored and delivered locally.  
Our goal is simple: to make education **accessible, fun, and available anywhere** ✨

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The ThinkCentre acts as a **local mini server** hosting the FlowHivee platform  
2. It creates its own **Wi-Fi network** using hostapd + dnsmasq  
3. Users connect via phone, tablet, or laptop  
4. They scan a **QR code** from the FlowHivee book or login screen  
5. The platform opens locally — all data is served directly from the server  
6. Students can access lessons, attempt quizzes, and track progress fully offline
