# ✨ FlowHivee 🌐⭐

**FlowHivee** is a complete **offline EdTech software** that runs entirely off-grid on a DIY mini server 💻.  
It’s hosted on a repurposed **Lenovo ThinkCentre** which creates its own **LAN (Local Area Network)** so anyone nearby can connect and learn **without needing the internet** 😭  

FlowHivee is designed for **rural areas** where access to online education is limited. It brings together lessons, quizzes, videos, notes, and progress tracking — all stored and delivered locally.  
Our goal is simple: to make education **accessible, fun, and available anywhere** ✨
